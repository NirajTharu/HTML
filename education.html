    <p>
      when I was small i don't know tha age of that time i started my school,
      which was in my village and was in the other tole(western) of my village.
      I have read in the class bal bikash and change the school to town named
      kalyanpur which is about 5 km form my village which was a long distance
      for me which is the reason i again change my school and start studying in
      village school and i read there upto class 3. I have finished my class 3
      there and change school which was in another district named sirha. Again i
      have started from class three and left the school after class 8 exam and
      join the school of mamagam(Phulbaidiya) and completed my class 10 there.
